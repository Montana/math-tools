    "\n",
    "**Proof by Case (Proof by Exhaustion)**: [give formal def]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof by Contradiction**: We want to prove $A$.  Assume $\\lnot A$, and show that this causes a Contradiction.\n",

    "## Induction\n",
    "\n",
    "Giving this its own section cus its so big. Note that induction is a form of Deductive Reasoning, so what we're doing here is not to be confused with other uses of the term.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base Case**: $n=1$ case is true\n",

    "**Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume it's true for previous step $n \\lte k$, show $k + 1$ is true.\n",

    "\n",
    "[I'll def write more on this later.  I'll need more experience on Induction proofs in practice.]\n",
    "\n",
    "[Also I think Induction itself depends on some set theory stuff like the successor function or the well ordering principle or somethin.. understand dat chain of logic.  \"..err, successor is not an axiom, it is built up with von neumann ordinals.  but would like to reduce this from successor to sets in explanation.]\n",
